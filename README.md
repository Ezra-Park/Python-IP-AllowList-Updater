# Python IP Allow List Updater

## üéØ Project Overview

This Python script automates the process of updating an IP address "allow list" by removing specified IP addresses. This is a practical task commonly faced in network security and system administration, where maintaining accurate access control lists is crucial. The script demonstrates basic file I/O, string manipulation, and list operations in Python.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Problem Statement

In many IT and security environments, IP allow lists are used to control network access. Manually removing multiple IP addresses from such a list can be tedious and prone to human error. This project addresses the need for an automated solution to efficiently clean an `allow_list.txt` file by removing a predefined set of "unwanted" IP addresses.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Language:** Python 3 (developed in a Jupyter Notebook environment, but runnable as a standard Python script)
* **Editor:** Jupyter Notebook (for initial development and testing)
* **Input File:** `allow_list.txt` (simple text file with IP addresses separated by spaces or newlines)

## üß† Algorithm & Script Breakdown

The automation is achieved through a simple, step-by-step Python algorithm:

1.  **Define Input and Removal List:**
    * `import_file`: Specifies the name of the text file containing the IP allow list.
    * `remove_list`: A Python list containing the IP addresses to be removed from the `allow_list.txt`.

2.  **Read File Contents:**
    * The `allow_list.txt` is opened in read mode (`"r"`).
    * The `with open(...) as file:` statement ensures the file is automatically closed, preventing resource leaks.
    * The entire content of the file (a string of IP addresses) is read into the `ip_addresses` variable.

3.  **Convert String to List:**
    * The `ip_addresses` string is split into a list of individual IP addresses using `.split()`. By default, `split()` separates the string by whitespace, making each IP address a separate list entry.

4.  **Remove Unwanted IP Addresses:**
    * The script iterates through each `element` (IP address) in the `ip_addresses` list.
    * If an `element` is found within the `remove_list`, it is removed from the `ip_addresses` list using `ip_addresses.remove(element)`.
    * **Note on Iteration:** While this approach works for small lists, for very large lists, iterating and removing from the same list can be inefficient. A more optimized approach for large datasets might involve creating a *new* list that only includes elements not in the `remove_list`. (This can be a "Future Improvements" idea!)

5.  **Convert List Back to String:**
    * The `ip_addresses` list is joined back into a single string, with each IP address separated by a space, using `" ".join(ip_addresses)`. This prepares the data for writing back to the file.

6.  **Update the File:**
    * The `allow_list.txt` file is opened in write mode (`"w"`).
    * The modified `ip_addresses` string is written back to the file, effectively overwriting the original content with the updated list.

## üöÄ How to Use (Simple Example)

1.  **Create `allow_list.txt`:**
    Create a file named `allow_list.txt` in the same directory as the Python script.
    *Example `allow_list.txt` content:*
    ```
    192.168.1.10 192.168.97.225 192.168.1.11 192.168.158.170 192.168.1.12
    192.168.201.40 192.168.1.13 192.168.58.57 192.168.1.14
    ```

2.  **Save the Python Script:**
    Save the following Python code as `update_allow_list.py` (or a similar name) in the same directory.

    ```python
    # Define the input file and the list of IPs to remove
    import_file = "allow_list.txt"
    remove_list = ["192.168.97.225", "192.168.158.170", "192.168.201.40", "192.168.58.57"]

    print(f"--- Starting IP Allow List Update ---")
    print(f"Input file: {import_file}")
    print(f"IPs to remove: {remove_list}")

    # Read the file contents
    try:
        with open(import_file, "r") as file:
            initial_ip_string = file.read()
            ip_addresses = initial_ip_string.split()
        print(f"\nInitial IP addresses (from file): {ip_addresses}")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: The file '{import_file}' was not found. Please create it.")
        exit()

    # Remove IP addresses that are on the remove list
    # Create a new list to avoid issues with removing elements during iteration
    updated_ip_list = []
    for element in ip_addresses:
        if element not in remove_list: # Only add elements that are NOT in the remove_list
            updated_ip_list.append(element)
    
    # Convert the updated list back into a string
    ip_addresses_string = " ".join(updated_ip_list)
    print(f"Updated IP addresses (as list): {updated_ip_list}")
    print(f"Updated IP addresses (as string): {ip_addresses_string}")


    # Update the file with the revised list of IP addresses
    with open(import_file, "w") as file:
        file.write(ip_addresses_string)
    
    print(f"\n--- Update Complete! '{import_file}' has been updated. ---")

    # Optional: Verify the update (you can run this part separately or manually check the file)
    # with open(import_file, "r") as file:
    #     verified_content = file.read()
    #     print(f"\nVerified content in '{import_file}':\n{verified_content}")
    ```

3.  **Run the Script:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the files, and run:
    ```bash
    python update_allow_list.py
    ```

## üìà Future Improvements

* **Function with Parameters:** Encapsulate the logic within a function that accepts `import_file` and `remove_list` as parameters, making it reusable.
* **Error Handling:** Add more robust error handling (e.g., for empty files, invalid IP formats).
* **More Efficient Removal:** For very large lists, using a `set` for `remove_list` and then list comprehension for filtering can be more efficient (`updated_ip_list = [ip for ip in ip_addresses if ip not in remove_set]`).
* **User Input:** Allow the user to input the file name and/or IP addresses to remove directly via the terminal.
* **Logging:** Implement basic logging to record when the script runs and what changes were made.
* **Backup:** Create a backup of the original `allow_list.txt` before modifying it.
